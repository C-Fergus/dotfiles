Arch branch of my dotfiles. I will try to integrate these into the original Ubuntu ones by using the improvements to things like vim and tmux, while allowing the Ubuntu and Arch initialisation scripts to exist together and be executed independently of each other, with a universal configuration file to decide what should be installed for each distribution and for what purposes that installation is for (e.g. full installation, programming, tty only, terminal only, gui light [web browsing, meme image making, and word processing], and gui heavy [lots of GUI editors and applications for programming, music making, image or video editing, etc...]).
