# Unix dotfiles

My Linux dotfiles. Initialise the repo using the following shell command:

    cd ~ &&
    git init &&
    git remote add origin https://github.com/C-Fergus/dotfiles.git &&
    git pull origin master

This will pull the repo into your home directory, allowing them to be used immediately.
